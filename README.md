This project presents an acoustic-based system for real-time drone detection and classification. The system identifies drones by analyzing their unique sound signatures and distinguishing them from environmental noise.

The work integrates hardware and software components:
a microphone array connected to an Arduino-based acquisition system captures acoustic signals from the environment, which are then processed in MATLAB. The project includes steps of signal acquisition, filtering, spectral feature extraction, and classification using both time- and frequency-domain analysis.

To make the system user-friendly, a dedicated MATLAB App Designer interface was developed. The application enables the user to record sounds, visualize waveforms and spectrograms, run classification algorithms, and monitor drone presence in real time.

This project demonstrates the full pipeline — from hardware integration and data collection to signal processing, algorithm development, and real-time visualization — providing a foundation for future autonomous drone detection systems based on sound analysis.
